# Distributed Key-Value Store in Go

## Overview
This project is an implementation of a distributed key-value store using Go. It's designed to demonstrate the basic principles of distributed systems, including inter-service communication using gRPC, data replication, and consensus algorithms (like Raft).

## Features
- **gRPC for Communication**: Efficient client-server communication.
- **In-Memory Key-Value Store**: Basic CRUD operations for data management.
- **Raft for Consensus**: Ensures data consistency across distributed nodes (planned integration).

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several packages, each handling a specific aspect of the system:

```plaintext
distributed-kvstore/
├── cmd/
│   ├── server/
│   │   └── main.go  (Server entry point)
│   └── client/
│       └── main.go  (Client entry point)
├── store/
│   └── store.go     (Key-Value store logic)
├── rpc/
│   └── rpc.go       (RPC service definitions)
└── raft/
    └── raft.go      (Raft consensus algorithm - placeholder)
```

## Prerequisites
- Go (1.15 or later)
- Protocol Buffers (protobuf)
- gRPC
- Raft library (like HashiCorp's Raft)

## Setup and Running
### Server
1. **Navigate to the Server Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd cmd/server
   ```
2. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
   The server will start and listen for connections.

### Client
1. **Open a New Terminal**.
2. **Navigate to the Client Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd cmd/client
   ```
3. **Run the Client**:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
   The client will connect to the server and can perform operations like `Put` and `Get`.

## Implementation Details
- `cmd/server/main.go`: Sets up the gRPC server and binds the key-value store service.
- `cmd/client/main.go`: A gRPC client that interacts with the key-value store service.
- `store/store.go`: Implements the in-memory key-value store logic.
- `rpc/rpc.go`: Contains the generated code from the protobuf definitions for the gRPC service.
- `raft/raft.go`: A placeholder for integrating the Raft consensus algorithm for data replication and fault tolerance.

## Raft Integration (Planned)
The Raft consensus algorithm will be integrated to ensure consistency and fault tolerance in the distributed environment. This will involve setting up Raft nodes, handling leader election, and log replication.

## Testing and Error Handling
Testing is crucial in distributed systems to ensure reliability and robustness. Thorough unit and integration tests will be written, focusing on network failures, data consistency, and fault tolerance.

## Further Enhancements
- **Dockerization**: Containerize the application for ease of deployment.
- **Scalability**: Implement load balancing and horizontal scaling.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Set up monitoring tools to track system performance and health.
